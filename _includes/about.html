      <p>An ICO is the new cool way to raise money. Since the number of projects and ideas is literally multiplying nowadays it becomes hard to see the greater picture. It feels like we operate in a really big bubble but nobody can be sure. </p> 
      <p>That is where SPCMN kicks in. We try to measure how wide the token bubble / moon has inflated until now. Are we close to the "big burst" or is there still space left to finally arrive at the moon?</p> 
      <p>Investing Ether into the Speculative Token definitely won't give you any value or benefits. Exchanging anything valueable for this token actually does not make any common sense.</p> 
      <p>But what is common sense? People earning millions by trading altcoins. You never know if a coin will skyrocket to the moon or fail. If you are one of the gold diggers out there: Support our idea and find out what happens!</p>
      <p>The bubble surely will burst. Someday. We try to find out how close we are.</p>

      <h4>Looks great</h4>

      <p>Everything looks so great. We set up a fancy website and used the cool polygon/particle theme like all the others.</p> 
      <p> We hosted the page on github.io to be as cool as all the pros out there. Look at all those fancy logos. We used sass, gulp, node.js, git, github and way more to set up this awesome non valuable coin.</p>
      <p>We just fucked up the logo with gimp. Sorry for that.</p>
      <p>We even wrote a whitepaper with fancy mathematics and different assumptions which might lead to some conclusions. Who cares about so many words, anyway? If you read it you'll understand that it is totally unnecessary. It does not say anything more than stated on the website.</p>
      <p>Maybe you should consider investing in real value. Real estate for example? Uhh.. shhhish. Yeah, also a bubble. Well, car loans?.. isshh.</p>

      <p>Maybe we'll make a presale. If not we don't. Depends on how we deep we can dig into the Ether smart contract shit.</p>
      <p>It's fun but timeconsuming. We are a big team. At least enough to say we instead of I. Technically, a group starts at three people. So we kind of made it even to a group. Sounds way more eleborated. Like a big company. If we hit our goals we will list the coin on exchanges.</p>
      <p>Have you noted that most new tokens or coins almost double in value directly after their listing on an exchange? So if you are fast you might even sell SPCMN with a profit. </p>
      <p>Ok, nevermind. Good luck to all golddiggers and astronauts out there!</p>
      <p>XOXO lumbersexual</p>
